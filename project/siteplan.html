          Paragraph Font: Shantell Sans <!-- change this -->
        </h4>
        <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
        <p>
          If you are looking for something special for that certian someone from crocheted afghans, potholders/hot pads to
          sock snowmen and ceramic coasters you are at the right place.
        </p>
        <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
        <p class="colored">
          During the start of the pandemic in 2020 I got into keeping myself busy and got more into making different crafts
          and taught myself how to make ceramic coasters made using alcohol ink made with a resin coating to seal them.
